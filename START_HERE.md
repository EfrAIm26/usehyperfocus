## 🎯 What You Have

### ✅ 3 Core Features (All Implemented)

#### 1. 🎯 Hyperfocus Mode
**Status: ✅ WORKING**

Keeps users focused on one topic at a time using AI-powered topic detection.

**Try it:**
1. Ask: "Explain photosynthesis"
2. After 2-3 messages, ask: "What is Python?"
3. See the alert! 🚨

**How it works:**
- AI analyzes each message for topic
- Compares to current focus topic
- Shows alert if topics differ too much
- User can continue or start new chat

#### 2. 📊 Mermaid Diagrams
**Status: ✅ WORKING**

Transforms concepts into visual diagrams automatically.

**Try it:**
1. Ask: "Create a mind map about AI"
2. Ask: "Show me a flowchart of HTTP requests"
3. Ask: "Visualize the water cycle"

**Features:**
- View/Code tabs
- Zoom controls
- Download PNG/SVG
- Edit and re-render
- Multiple diagram types

#### 3. ⚡ Fast Reading (Bionic)
**Status: ✅ WORKING**

Enhances reading speed by bolding word prefixes.

**Try it:**
1. Open Settings (⚙️ icon)
2. Select "Fast Reading (Bionic)"
3. Send any message
4. Notice the **bol**ded **pre**fixes!

**Algorithm:**
- 1 char → 100% bold
- 2-3 chars → 50% bold  
- 4-5 chars → 50% bold
- 6-8 chars → 40% bold
- 9+ chars → 35% bold
